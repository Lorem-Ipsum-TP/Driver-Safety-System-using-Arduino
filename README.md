# Driver-Safety-System-using-Arduino
-> TARP Project
* VehicleModule has code related to the our car simulator part with various sensors
-> All pin connections are mentioned in the code
-> Install LiquidCrystal_I2C library from Arduino IDE for interfacing the LCD

* HeadKitModule has code related to the wearable head kit designed by us.
-> All pin connections are mentioned in the code.
-> Install TMRpcm,SD,SPI,SoftwareSerial library from Arduino IDE or from github for interfacing with SD card module for audio messages, for Text Messaging/Calling using SIM800L V2 module.

* Circuit Photo
-> Contains demo circuit diagram, the extact pin connections are not used in the project and in the code.
-> Its aim is just to show the hardware connection layout for our project.

* alert message is the audio message used to alert the driver
* DHT_Library is for interfacing with the Temperature sensor
* Tarp_project_report.pdf is the final report of our project.
* Live Project Demonstration: [Youtube_Video](https://youtu.be/lGitoWjo3aw)
